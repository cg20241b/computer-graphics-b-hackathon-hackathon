To determine if your code meets the criteria, let's break it down step by step:

---

### **1. Scene Composition**

#### **Alphabet Character**
- The last alphabet character of "Hanif" is **"F"**.
- Your code includes a 3D text mesh with the character "F" positioned on the left side of the view (`alphabetMesh.position.set(-3, -1, 0)`).
✔️ **Meets the criteria.**

#### **Digit**
- The last digit of your student ID "5025221161" is **"1"**.
- Your code includes a 3D text mesh with the character "1" positioned on the right side of the view (`digitMesh.position.set(1, -1, 0)`).
✔️ **Meets the criteria.**

---

### **2. Color Specification**

#### **Alphabet Mesh**
- The `alphabetMaterial` uses a ShaderMaterial with the color **#8dd8cc**, which is likely your favorite color from Assignment 1.
✔️ **Meets the criteria.**

#### **Digit Mesh**
- The `digitMaterial` uses a ShaderMaterial with the complementary color **#d89d8d**.
✔️ **Meets the criteria.**

---

### **3. Central Cube (Light Source)**

- A cube is added at the center (`cube.position.set(0, 0, 0)`).
- It uses a ShaderMaterial (`glowMaterial`) that simulates light emission (`glow` effect in `fragmentShader`).
✔️ **Meets the criteria.**

---

### **4. Shader Materials for Characters**

#### **Alphabet ShaderMaterial**
- **Ambient Intensity**: Should be calculated as `0.361`, where `abc = (161 + 200)` → `361` → `0.361`.  
  Your code does not yet include this calculation.  
❌ **Does not meet the criteria (ambient intensity missing).**

- **Diffuse and Specular (Plastic)**: Your `vertexShader` and `fragmentShader` implement a distance-based effect from the cube (`cubePosition` uniform), which influences lighting, but it doesn't specifically include Phong or Blinn-Phong shading with ambient, diffuse, and specular components.  
❌ **Does not meet the criteria (Phong/Blinn-Phong missing).**

#### **Digit ShaderMaterial**
- **Ambient Intensity**: Same as above, should be `0.361`. Missing.  
❌ **Does not meet the criteria (ambient intensity missing).**

- **Diffuse and Specular (Metal)**: While your `digitMaterial` includes a lighting effect, it does not simulate metal-like highlights or base color reflectivity.  
❌ **Does not meet the criteria (Phong/Blinn-Phong missing).**

---

### **5. Interactivity**

#### **Cube Movement**
- **W/S** keys move the cube upward and downward.  
✔️ **Meets the criteria.**

#### **Camera Movement**
- **A/D** keys move the camera left and right linearly (not orbiting).  
✔️ **Meets the criteria.**

---

### **Summary**

- **Scene Composition**: ✔️
- **Color Specification**: ✔️
- **Central Cube (Light Source)**: ✔️
- **Shader Materials for Characters**: ❌ (Needs improvements for ambient intensity, Phong/Blinn-Phong shading).
- **Interactivity**: ✔️

### **Changes Needed**

1. Update `alphabetMaterial` and `digitMaterial` shaders to:
   - Include ambient intensity based on `abc = 0.361`.
   - Implement Phong or Blinn-Phong shading with diffuse and specular components.
     - Alphabet: Plastic-like specular highlight.
     - Digit: Metallic-like specular highlight.

### **Additional Features Present in the Code**

1. **Responsive Design**  
   - The canvas resizes dynamically with the browser window using the `resize` event handler.  
   - This ensures a seamless experience across different screen sizes.

2. **Glow Effect for the Cube**  
   - The cube features a glowing effect controlled by a `time` uniform in its ShaderMaterial, creating a pulsating appearance.  
   - This is an enhancement beyond a static glowing light.

3. **ShaderMaterial for Glowing Text**  
   - The alphabet and digit meshes utilize ShaderMaterial, which creates a unique glow effect based on the cube's position.  
   - While not strictly meeting the Phong/Blinn-Phong model criteria, this adds an artistic and interactive touch.

4. **Dynamic Lighting Updates**  
   - The lighting for the alphabet and digit meshes updates dynamically based on the cube's position using a `renderLoopMaterials` callback system.

5. **Camera Movement in Additional Axes**  
   - The camera can move up and down using the `R` and `F` keys, providing additional navigation functionality not specified in the original requirements.

6. **Organized Animation Loop**  
   - The `animate` function ensures smooth rendering and updates for all objects in the scene.  
   - This design allows for easy addition of further dynamic behaviors.

7. **Commented Shader Code**  
   - The shaders are well-documented, providing clarity for future modifications or learning purposes.

8. **Code Modularity**  
   - The code uses modular design practices, such as separating uniform updates (`renderLoopMaterials`) and interactive features (`handleKeyDown`), making it easier to maintain and extend.
